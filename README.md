# 3D-RTS-SchoolProject
This is a single player real time strategy game developed for the computer and hololens inspired by the Starcraft II Arcade game "Mines and Magic" with a mix of medieval and 1920's-style futurism as the asthetic theme.

Defend your castle and save your village! A greedy neighboring civilization is invading, carrying soldiers and weapons on a giant train. Save your villagers by training them to fight! Scout out and use the resources around you wisely to make the best weapons, armor, and to put out the fires in the village. 

Developed in Unity using C# exclusively.
